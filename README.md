# Reducing Employee Turnover: A Data-Driven Approach
### Background
As a part of the human capital department in a large corporation, we are tasked with addressing the issue of relatively high employee turnover. The Board is concerned about the number of employees leaving the company, and our team's objective is to analyze the situation, identify factors that influence employee churn, and propose effective strategies to reduce turnover.

### Data Overview
Our team has access to a comprehensive dataset with almost 10,000 employee records. The data includes the following attributes:

department: The department to which the employee belongs.
promoted: A binary variable (1 or 0) indicating if the employee was promoted in the last 24 months.
review: The composite score received by the employee in their last evaluation.
projects: The number of projects the employee is currently involved in.
salary: Salary information is categorized into three tiers: low, medium, and high for confidentiality reasons.
tenure: The number of years the employee has been with the company.
satisfaction: A measure of employee satisfaction obtained from surveys.
bonus: A binary variable (1 or 0) indicating if the employee received a bonus in the last 24 months.
avg_hrs_month: The average number of hours the employee worked per month.
left: A binary variable ("yes" or "no") indicating whether the employee left the company.

### Data Analysis Approach
Our approach to reducing employee turnover involves the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between variables and their impact on employee turnover.

Identify Factors Influencing Turnover: Use statistical methods to identify key factors that significantly influence employee churn.

Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast the likelihood of an employee leaving the company.

Feature Importance Analysis: Determine the most important features that contribute to employee turnover and focus on addressing those areas.

Employee Segmentation: Segment employees based on characteristics and behaviors to tailor retention strategies for different groups.

Implement Retention Strategies: Based on the analysis, propose and implement targeted strategies to retain employees, such as improving job satisfaction, career advancement opportunities, and work-life balance.

### Deliverables
Our final report will include the following components:

Overview of Employee Turnover: A summary of the current turnover rate, highlighting the magnitude of the problem.

Factors Influencing Turnover: Insights into the key factors that contribute to employee churn, backed by data analysis.

Predictive Models: Details of the predictive models developed to forecast employee turnover and assess their accuracy.

Feature Importance Analysis: Identification of the most critical features influencing employee churn.

Employee Segmentation: Categorization of employees into groups based on characteristics and behavior, enabling targeted retention strategies.

Proposed Retention Strategies: Specific recommendations on how to reduce employee turnover, including improving job satisfaction, career growth, and work-life balance.

By following this data-driven approach, we aim to provide the organization with actionable insights and effective strategies to significantly reduce employee turnover and improve overall employee retention.
